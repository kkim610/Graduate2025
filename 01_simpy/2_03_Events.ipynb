    "SimPy events are very similar – if not identical — to deferreds, futures or promises. Instances of the class Event are used to describe any kind of events. Events can be in one of the following states. An event\n",

    "- might happen (not triggered),\n",
    "\n",
    "- is going to happen (triggered) or\n",
    "\n",
    "- has happened (processed).\n",
    "\n",
    "They traverse these states exactly once in that order. Events are also tightly bound to time and time causes events to advance their state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, events are not triggered and just objects in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an event gets triggered, it is scheduled at a given time and inserted into SimPy’s event queue. The property Event.triggered becomes True.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the event is not processed, you can add callbacks to an event. Callbacks are callables that accept an event as parameter and are stored in the Event.callbacks list.\n",
    "\n",
    "An event becomes processed when SimPy pops it from the event queue and calls all of its callbacks. It is now no longer possible to add callbacks. The property Event.processed becomes True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Events also have a value. The value can be set before or when the event is triggered and can be retrieved via Event.value or, within a process, by yielding the event (value = yield event).\n"
