    "As it happens, a SimPy Process can be used like an event (technically, a process actually is an event). If you yield it, you are resumed once the process has finished. Imagine a car-wash simulation where cars enter the car-wash and wait for the washing process to finish. Or an airport simulation where passengers have to wait until a security check finishes.\n",

    "The run process is automatically started when Car is instantiated. A new charge process is started every time the vehicle starts parking. By yielding the Process instance that Environment.process() returns, the run process starts waiting for it to finish:"
